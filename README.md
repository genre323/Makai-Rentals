<h1>Makai Rentals connects users & partners to provide an automated water sports equipment rental solution. Due to the proprietary nature of the code, only code snippets of the project have been uploaded. Makai is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.</h1>

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the reservation form for Makai's products. I was tasked with developing the back-end as well as the front-end. 
Below is a list of actions that I took to complete the project.

● Developed the Reservations component which allowed users to seamlessly create product reservations.

● Integrated payment verification with Stripe & date range conflict constraints with SQL procedures for specific rental items.

● Wrote SQL procedures that joined foreign key tables to return a specific list of products based on the location selected by the user when creating a reservation.

● Implemented a DatePicker calendar in the wizard form with date range & time selection constraints.

● Produced a multi-step wizard form using the React-Loki library which pulled product data from the database a mapped it to multiple drop-down selectors.

● Created & maintained complex multi-table datasets with joins & subqueries, as well as stored procedures that allowed users to request data & visualize it within customized front-end content components.

● Created fully functional front-end interfaces utilizing React.js, Bootstrap, & JavaScript.

● Collaborated with team members & senior developers utilizing AGILE methodologies to ensure product guidelines & milestones were met. Conducted daily group stand-ups to track production & accountability, while also working closely together to ensure proper source control using Git & Github.
